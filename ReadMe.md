## Overview

This week introduces the basic data structures and algorithms every Java developer should know. You'll also explore Java's built-in utilities for handling text and input/output efficiently, and gain a solid foundation in analyzing your code's performance using Big-O notation.

## Topics Covered

### Day 1: Data Structure Introduction and LinkedList

- What are data structures?
- Why use them?
- LinkedList: implementation, insertion, deletion, traversal
- Singly vs. Doubly Linked Lists

### Day 2: Stack, Queue, HashMap, and Hashing

- Stack and Queue: concepts, use cases, Java implementation
- HashMap: key-value pairs, collision handling, hashing function
- HashSet (brief intro)
- Practical hashing scenarios

### Day 3: Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort (intro)
- Comparison of sorting algorithms

### Day 4 & 5: Searching and Java I/O Utilities

- Linear Search and Binary Search
- StringBuilder and StringBuffer
- BufferedReader, FileReader, InputStreamReader
- Efficient string manipulation and input handling in Java

### Day 6: Algorithm Analysis

- Time and Space Complexity
- Big-O Notation: Best, Worst, and Average Cases
- Trade-offs in choosing data structures and algorithms
